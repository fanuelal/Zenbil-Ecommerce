# What inspired me?
In Ethiopia it takes much time for buying goods and also it is hard to get what we want by comparing from other products.And also for sellers it is hard to get customers easily.
## So what area can this project solve problems?
We have wide fields to solve for the feature like
- Digital Market
- AI Behavioral analytic
- Promotional for sellers
- cloud shop

But at this time this project can be used for the online certifying platforms to check if their student itself is working on exams without manual detection.So if many students want to certify at the same time they should be fully validated and also can be managed with this AI system without video calls.
